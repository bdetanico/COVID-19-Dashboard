Repository with Tableau to interactively compare cases and deaths by country using the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) data.







The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health emergency.

- On 31 December 2019, the WHO (World Health Organization) China Country Office was informed of cases of unknown aetiology pneumonia (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.
- The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus, which was isolated on 7 January 2020.
- On 30 January the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

All coronaviruses that have caused diseases to humans have had animal origins, generally in bats, rodents, civet cats and dromedary camels. WHO informs that the COVID-19 most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats, and the transmission to humans has likely occurred through an intermediate animal host â€“ a domestic animal, a wild animal or a domesticated wild animal which has not yet been identified.

The current project collects the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The repository is updated daily and contains time series data on confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases.
